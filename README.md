CounterClock
============

    A timer/clock that persists during screen off and screen lock.

-How it works:

    This is inspired off the of the Active Notifications concept that
    Motorola came out with on the Moto X.  Some developers have issued
    phenominal replicas on the play and ChameleonOS came out the with 
    their own implementation in their ROM.
    
    This is a clock and/or timer that will stay on the screen even during
    a screen off or power off event.  The screen goes black except for the
    clock, allowing AMOLED screens to save battery life while the timer 
    ticks in a screen off and locked state.
    
    This is useful because it allows you set a timer and set the phone down
    on a surface.  When the screen shuts off, you will still be able to see
    the timer, pause, stop and reset the timer, as well as simply unlock the
    screen, bypassing the lock screen taking you directly to your last active
    application


- Other notes:

    This project has a ton of development work to be done.  Right now, the 
    basic concept is there; text appears on screen off and power off, the 
    screen can be unlocked while bypassing the lock screen.  Other than 
    that, there is nothing else.
    
    As I work on this project, I will update this readme with developer notes.
